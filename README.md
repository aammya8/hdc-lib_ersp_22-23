## Overview


- Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Classification Algorithm Library for deployment on hardware-limited edge devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks with a maximum input voltage of 3.3V.
- Achieved 80% classification accuracy on Arduino Uno and ESP8266 microcontroller boards tested on the ISOLET dataset.
- HDC input data encoding methods optimized to <0.1W energy consumption:
  - Random Projection
  - ID-Level
- Research completed under the mentorship of Professor Tajana Rosing and PhD Candidate Xiaofan Yu, and is to be
deployed in the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve for environmental monitoring applications.
